# Alerts Documentation

## Overview
The Alerts folder contains configurations and documentation related to monitoring and notifications for the air quality data pipeline. In this setup, only logging groups are utilized to track errors from AWS Lambda, AWS Glue, and other services, without the use of custom alarms or metrics.

## Contents

### Alert Configuration Files
- **CloudWatch Logs Configuration:** Documentation on how logging groups are set up to capture errors from various AWS services, including AWS Lambda and AWS Glue.

### Alert Scripts
- **Error Monitoring Scripts:** Scripts that analyze logs from the logging groups to identify and report errors. These scripts can be scheduled to run periodically.

### Documentation
- **Logging Strategy Document:** A markdown file outlining the logging strategy, including how logs are captured, monitored, and reviewed for errors.
- **Best Practices for Logging:** Guidelines for effective logging practices, including log retention policies and error handling.

### Sample Alerts
- **Example Error Messages:** Sample error messages captured in the logging groups, providing insight into common issues encountered.
- **Test Logging Procedures:** Documentation on how to test logging configurations to ensure errors are captured correctly.

### Monitoring Dashboards
- **Dashboard Configuration Files:** JSON or YAML files that define the setup for monitoring dashboards in CloudWatch, focusing on log group metrics and error tracking.

## Conclusion
In this implementation, the focus is on utilizing logging groups to monitor errors from AWS services, ensuring that any issues are captured and can be reviewed without the complexity of custom alarms or metrics. This approach simplifies monitoring while still providing essential insights into the system's health.
