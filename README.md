# Air Quality Data Pipeline Project

## Overview
The Air Quality Data Pipeline Project is designed to process air quality data using both batch and real-time methods. This project utilizes KAPSPARC as a source for batch data and OpenWeatherMap for both batch and real-time data, covering the period from 2019 to 2025.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Sources:**
  - **KAPSPARC:** Used for batch data processing.
  - **OpenWeatherMap:** Utilized for both batch and real-time data processing.
  
- **Data Processing:**
  - Implemented a pipeline that handles both batch and real-time data ingestion.
  - Processed data is stored in Amazon S3 for further analysis.

- **Architecture Diagram:**
  Below is the architecture diagram that illustrates the components and flow of the data pipeline:
